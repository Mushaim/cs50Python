# Dungeon Escape 🏰⚔️

A text-based dungeon crawler built in Python for the **CS50P final project**.
The game uses **OOP design** with reusable classes (`Character`, `Player`, `Enemy`) and features:

- Player progression (XP, levels, score).
- Inventory system with **potions** (consumables) and **unique permanent loot** (Shield, Magic Sword, Ring of Vitality).
- Random dungeon events: **combat, healing fountains, or empty corridoors**.
- Escape mechanic: after a random number of steps, the player can find the exit.
- Win condition: survive and escape the dungeon.
- Lose condition: die in combat.
